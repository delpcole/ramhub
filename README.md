# RamHub

A private, school-email-only community website for students of **Farmingdale State
College**. Look up any course or professor, read honest advice from students who
actually took it, and add your own.

Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) before contributing — it holds the architecture
decisions, MongoDB constraints, and conventions this project is built on.

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | 3.12+ | Built and tested on 3.13 |
| Node.js | 20+ | Only used to build the Tailwind CSS |
| MongoDB Atlas | any free cluster | A replica set — required for transactions |

**Versions are locked together.** `django-mongodb-backend` X.Y.* only works with
Django X.Y.*. We are on Django 6.1.1 + django-mongodb-backend 6.1.0. Upgrade
them in the same pull request or not at all.

---

## First-time setup

```bash
# 1. Python environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Node packages (Tailwind only)
npm install

# 3. Environment variables
cp .env.example .env              # then edit .env — see the table below

# 4. Build the stylesheet once
npm run tailwind:build

# 5. Create the collections Django needs
python manage.py migrate
```

### Environment variables

`.env` is gitignored. Never commit it, and never put a connection string in a
settings file.

| Variable | Required | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SECRET_KEY` | prod | Django signing key. Dev falls back to an insecure default. |
| `DEBUG` | no | `True` locally, `False` everywhere else. |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | prod | Comma-separated hostnames. |
| `MONGODB_URI` | **yes** | The full Atlas connection string. |
| `MONGODB_NAME` | no | Database name inside the cluster. Defaults to `ramhub`. |
| `COLLEGE_EMAIL_DOMAIN` | no | Domain allowed to register. Defaults to `farmingdale.edu`. |

Generate a key for `.env` with:

```bash
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key as g; print(g())"
```

### Pointing it at Atlas

1. In Atlas, create a free **M0** cluster.
2. **Database Access** → add a database user with a password.
3. **Network Access** → add your IP (or `0.0.0.0/0` while developing).
4. **Connect → Drivers → Python** → copy the connection string.
5. Paste it into `.env` as `MONGODB_URI`, replacing `<password>` with the real
   password. URL-encode any special characters in it.

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://ramhub:REALPASSWORD@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
MONGODB_NAME=ramhub
```

The whole URI is passed straight through as the database `HOST`. Older
`django-mongodb-backend` tutorials call a `parse_uri()` helper — it no longer
exists in 6.1. Do not add it back.

---

## Running it

Two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — the site
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver
```

```bash
# Terminal 2 — rebuild CSS as you edit templates
npm run tailwind:watch
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>. The design system lives at
<http://localhost:8000/styleguide>.

If a class you added has no effect, the Tailwind watcher is not running.

---

## Checks

Both must pass before you open a pull request. CI runs them on every PR.

```bash
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
pytest
```

Useful extras:

```bash
python manage.py check          # Django system checks
ruff format .                   # apply formatting
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Layout

```
config/              settings/{base,dev,prod}.py, urls, views for site-level pages
  mongo_apps.py      MongoDB-compatible AppConfigs for Django's contrib apps
  context_processors.py  builds the nav and marks the active tab
apps/                accounts, catalog, ratings, community, campus, saved,
                     assistant, moderation
templates/           base.html, partials/, one directory per app
static/src/          input.css — every design token lives here
static/css/          built output (gitignored)
static/vendor/       htmx
tests/               project-level tests; per-app tests live in apps/*/tests/
```

Per CLAUDE.md, each app grows `views.py`, `urls.py`, `forms.py`,
`serializers.py`, `services.py`, `admin.py`, and `tests/` as it needs them.
Business logic goes in `services.py`, never in a view or a template.

---

## The design system

All tokens are defined in [`static/src/input.css`](static/src/input.css) and
rendered on `/styleguide`. **Never hardcode a color, size, or radius in a
template** — the default Tailwind color and type scales are deliberately cleared,
so if a utility does not exist, add the token first.

Shared patterns: `.btn-primary` `.btn-secondary` `.btn-ghost` `.btn-danger`,
`.field-input` `.field-input-error` `.field-label` `.field-hint` `.field-error`,
`.card` `.card-pad` `.row-link`, `.badge-neutral` `.badge-accent` `.badge-danger`,
`.rating-value`.

Reusable partials: `partials/page_header.html`, `partials/empty_state.html`,
and the icon set in `partials/icons/`.

---

## HTMX

htmx 2.0.10 is vendored at `static/vendor/htmx.min.js`. `base.html` sets
`hx-headers` with Django's CSRF token on `<body>`, so POSTs work without any
per-form wiring.

An HTMX endpoint returns an **HTML fragment**, not JSON — see
`config.views.styleguide_htmx_demo` and `partials/htmx_demo_result.html` for the
pattern. JSON belongs in a DRF endpoint under `/api/`. Pick one per feature.
